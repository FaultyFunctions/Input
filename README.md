# Input Community Data

This data, originatating in the `communtity-data` branch of the reposistory for the [Input project](https://github.com/JujuAdams/Input/), is a source for extended gamepad handling with GameMaker Studio, manually authored from local testing and information sourced from the [community game controller mapping database for SDL](https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB).

The data is intended for processing by Input's [datafile refresher](https://github.com/JujuAdams/Input/blob/dev/refresh_datafiles.py) which packs the annotated data to CSV.
