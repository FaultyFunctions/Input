# Supplementary Notes

---

The following pages include general information about Input's underlying systems as well as related subjects external to the library itself.

?> The Input project generally refers to handheld game controller devices as *gamepads* in order to avoid confusion with more [generalized definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) of the term *controller*. For consistency with the SDL project we make sole exception when reffering to the _Game Controller Mapping_ system.
