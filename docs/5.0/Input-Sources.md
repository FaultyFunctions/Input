# Input Sources

---

GameMaker has numerous potential input sources - keyboard, mouse, gamepads - and Input provides a single interface to manage input from all of them.

?> Normally, each player will only want to use one source at a time. Input does offer functionality to use more than one source at a time should you need that - this is covered below.
